            <p>Asalam-o-Alaikum</p>
            <br />
            <p>Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? (Surat
                Baqara, Verse 245)</p>
            <br />
            <p>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, instills upon his his men to give
                Qarz-e-Hasna decause it is in man's nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks about
                qarz because it is return the goodly loan by 70 folds.
                Allah conveys his message to the Muslims ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to
                spend their wealth in a certain way. He says,Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your wealth. If you do
                so, no fire, flood or thieves will be able to rob you off your money.
                Instead, you will be endowed with your wealth when you most need it. He further says that the poor and
                weak will not remain hungry and naked except due to the negligence of the rich, who should not be stingy
                in spending their money on those worse off than themselves.
                Allah will not only take strict accountability from those people but he will also punish them
                accordingly. On the Day Of Judgement, the rich will be hmiliated because the di not help the needy. The
                needy will complain to Allah and say that all those men on whom you
                gracoiusly bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence in its proper use; they were busy spending on
                themselves and forget about us, the ones who needed it. Allah will reply to this and says: "I swear on
                my respect and glory! I will bring you closer to me and push them further away." </p>
            <br />
            <p>Alhumdollilah, Allah has accorded our organization with the highest favour by spending those people our
                way who follow the teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith, give zakar, fidyah, fitrah, khairat and other
                donations to help us those in need. The purpose of sending this message
                to you is so that you not only spread this message to others but also play your part in helping us to
                serving the needy till the Day of Judgement. </p>
